# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard


1️. Project Title:

Customer Churn Analysis using Power BI


2️. Short Description

This project is about understanding why customers leave a business (churn) by analyzing their behavior using Power BI.
The dashboard helps visualize key patterns, trends, and customer segments, which businesses can use to improve customer retention.
I worked on every step — from cleaning and preparing the data to creating DAX formulas and designing the final dashboard.


3️. Tech Stack / Tools Used

✅Power BI Desktop – for data modeling and dashboard design
✅ Power Query – for data cleaning and transformation
✅ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – to create calculated measures and KPIs
✅ CSV / Excel files – as the data source


4️. Data Source

The data is based on a Customer Churn dataset (commonly available on platforms like Kaggle).
It includes information such as:

Customer ID
Gender, Age, Senior Citizen
Payment Methods and Monthly Charges
Tenure (how long the customer stayed)
Churn status (Yes/No – if the customer left)

5️. Features / Highlights

🔹 5.1 Data Preparation
Cleaned the raw data using Power Query
Removed duplicate and missing values
Changed data types (e.g., text, numbers, dates) for accurate analysis

🔹 5.2 Data Modeling
Built relationships between tables (star schema)
Created dimension tables (like Gender, Services) and fact table (Customer Info)

🔹 5.3 DAX Calculations
Created important measures using DAX, such as:
Total Customers
Churned Customers
Churn Rate %
Average Monthly Charges
Revenue Lost due to Churn
Customer Lifetime Value

🔹 5.4 Dashboard Design
Designed a professional, interactive Power BI dashboard
Added visualizations like:
KPI cards
Pie and column charts
Line charts for trend analysis
Slicers for filtering by Churn Status.
